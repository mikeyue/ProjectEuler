Don't spoil it for yourself if you intend to work on it :>

**From the FAQ:**<br>
I learned so much solving problem XXX so is it okay to publish my solution elsewhere?

*It appears that you have answered your own question. There is nothing quite like that "Aha!" moment when you finally beat a problem which you have been working on for some time. It is often through the best of intentions in wishing to share our insights so that others can enjoy that moment too. Sadly, however, that will not be the case for your readers. Real learning is an active process and seeing how it is done is a long way from experiencing that epiphany of discovery. Please do not deny others what you have so richly valued yourself.*
